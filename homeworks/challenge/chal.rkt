#lang racket

(provide myeval)

; Read the instruction of document carefully,
; and then write code according to it.

; This `myeval` function should mimic the behavior of `eval`,
; which is a built-in function of Racket.

; You should raise exceptions for irregular situations.
; The exception message doesn't have to be the same as `eval`,
; but the message should contain useful information.

(define (myeval e)
  'TODO)
